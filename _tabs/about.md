# About Me

Hi, I’m **Sakthi LK**, a Computer Science Engineering student from Chennai, India.  
I’m passionate about **software development, system design, competitive programming, and AI chatbots**.  

I love building projects that solve real problems and exploring different domains like:  
- Full-stack web development (React, Next.js, Node.js, Supabase, Python)  
- Mobile app development (React Native, Flutter)  
- Backend platforms, API design, and system architecture  
- Open-source contributions and community-driven projects  

Some of my notable GitHub repositories include:  
- 📊 **react-horizontal-heatmap** – a lightweight React component for horizontal heatmaps, fully customizable, ⭐ 15 stars, 600 downloads/week  
- 🚮 **Plentastic** – a Flutter app that rewards users for responsibly disposing of plastic waste  
- 🐙 **Kumo** – a React-based media manager to organize movies, TV series, anime, manga, books, and games  
- ♟️ **Eevee** – a chess engine built using Python
- 🎵 **Butterscotch** – a React Native music player app with playlists, offline downloads, and mini-player support  

Outside of coding, I enjoy chess, writing blogs, and sharing knowledge through online communities like **GitHub, Hashnode, Codeforces, and Instagram**.  

I’m always curious, constantly learning, and eager to work on impactful projects that bring technology closer to people.
