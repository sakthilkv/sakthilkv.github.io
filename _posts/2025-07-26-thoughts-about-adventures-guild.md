# Adventurer's Guild is underutilised in fiction

In most of the mainstream fiction like animes, games, and novel, adventurer's guild is just an convenient plot device to bring people together and provide a reason for the player to fight. Before I yap about 'insert title here', let me give an quick text book definition of adventurer's guild.

## What is Adventurer's Guild?

```
An Adventurer's Guild is an organized association or institution, typically found in fantasy settings, that registers, regulates, and supports individuals known as adventurers. These guilds act as intermediaries between adventurers and clients, distributing quests or missions in exchange for rewards, while also providing services such as lodging, training, information, and legal protection.

TL;DR: It's basically LinkedIn for adventurers.

So now you get the gist of what it is. Let's talk about what it actually can be...

## The Untapped potential of the Adventurer's Guild

Adventurer's Guild is an organization that spans across several kingdoms around the world. It's a rich and complex network that surpasses small kingdoms not only in manpower but also in wealth. Economy of Adventurer's Guild is nothing to laugh at. This is an private organization that does not answer to the rulers of the kingdom. 

Imagine the storylines that can be drawn from here. Since adventurer's guild isn't under the rule of any kingdom, it can preserve history and knowledge in it's purest form, untainted by political agendas or royal censorship.

In a world torn by war and conflict, the Adventurer's Guild might be the only neutral force left. It could act as a peacekeeping body, offering mediation between kingdoms, protecting civilians, or enforcing treaties when governments fail. Because it serves no crown, it can be trusted to protect people rather than power.

The guild might even regulate the use of dangerous magic, ancient artifacts, or lost technologies. With its own rules and internal code, it becomes the only force capable of preventing catastrophic misuse of forbidden powers. Adventurers trained and licensed by the guild would then act as investigators and enforcers.

Economically, the guild could become more powerful than small nations. Adventurers bring back rare items, monster parts, and legendary materials that fuel entire industries. The guild could operate its own currency, banking system, and auction houses, making it a financial giant that nations are forced to deal with, sometimes, even depend on.

In more magical or high-concept worlds, the guild might even manage portals to other realms, regulating interdimensional travel, conducting diplomatic missions, or protecting reality from cosmic threats. It could become a bridge between worlds, with guild halls acting as hubs of interplanar civilization.

## Conclusion

The Adventurer's Guild has the potential to be so much more than a glorified job board. It can be the backbone of a world’s lore, a neutral superpower, a preserver of truth, and a symbol of resistance against corruption and tyranny. By exploring its untapped depth as an institution with its own politics, economy, and secrets, storytellers can breathe new life into fantasy worlds and create plots that go far beyond simple dungeon runs. It’s time we stop treating the Adventurer's Guild as a background mechanic and start making it the heart of the story.
