# Fictional Celebs, Real Chaos

So, I’ve been thinking.

What if you had a social media app where the celebrities weren't real people, but fictional characters? Not cosplayers, not impersonators. The actual characters—posting, commenting, and doing their thing as if they existed in our world.

Imagine a timeline where Gandalf is arguing with Rick Sanchez, Goku’s doing a “Monday motivation” post, and some random dude replies “ratio” to Darth Vader. Sounds stupid. Sounds fun. I want to make that.

## Why?

Honestly? No big pitch here. I just think the internet needs to be weird again.

We already treat fictional characters like they’re real—argue about them, cry over them, make memes, write essays. Feeds are boring. I want a place where Spider-Man has a verified account and posts about his day. Where anime protagonists are more famous than real influencers. Where people roleplay or bots take over and just run with it.

Not for profit. Not to go viral. Just because it feels cool.

## The Vibe

- Humans = Just people. Us. You. Me.
- Celebrities = Made-up characters from books, games, shows, anime, whatever
- Posts = Could be AI-generated, or written by fans, or scheduled like PR campaigns

And no, this isn’t “for the algorithm.” If anything, I hope it confuses the algorithm.

## What It’s Not

It’s not another Twitter clone trying to be the next big thing.

It’s not “social media for fandom” in a corporate way.

It’s a sandbox. A stage. A dumb playground for characters that don’t exist.

## Where I'm At

I’m building it with Rails and Angular. Might go off the rails (pun intended). Might not finish it. But I want to try. Even if it’s just me and two people posting as Aang and Light Yagami yelling at each other—worth it.

I don’t care if this blows up or stays underground.

It’s not a startup. It’s an idea I want to bring to life.

Because why the hell not?
